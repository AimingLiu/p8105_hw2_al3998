## Problem 1

``` r
#Import the data#
mrtrash_data = read_excel("~/Desktop/data science/p8105_hw2_al3998/data/WheelTotals.xlsx",
              sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",range = "A2:N338")%>%
             janitor::clean_names()%>% 
             drop_na(dumpster)%>%
             mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits = 0)))

preci_17_data = read_excel("~/Desktop/data science/p8105_hw2_al3998/data/WheelTotals.xlsx",
                           sheet = "2017 Precipitation",skip = 1)%>%
                janitor::clean_names()%>%
                drop_na(total)%>%
                mutate(year = "2017")             

preci_18_data = read_excel("~/Desktop/data science/p8105_hw2_al3998/data/WheelTotals.xlsx",
                           sheet = "2018 Precipitation",skip = 1)%>%
                janitor::clean_names()%>%
                drop_na(total)%>%
                mutate(year = "2018")
preci_data = full_join(preci_17_data,preci_18_data, by = c("total", "year", "month"))%>%

mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

After reading and cleaning the data in the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet,there
are 285 obs.of 14 variables,the variable columns in the data set include
“dumpster”,“month”,“year”,“date” ,“sports\_balls”and some other
columns,among which all the numbers in the column “sports\_balls” have
been transformed into integer.

After reading and cleaning the data in the 2018 Precipitation,there are
8 obs.of 3 variables including columns month,total and year. After
reading and cleaning the data in the 2017 Precipitation,there are 13
obs.of 3 variables including columns of month,total and year.

After combining 2018 Precipitation and 2017 Precipitation, the data in
the data set called preci\_data include month,total and year.

The total precipitation in 2018 is 23.5 And the median of sports balls
in a dumpster in 2017 is
8

## Problem 2

``` r
pols_month_data = read_csv("~/Desktop/data science/p8105_hw2_al3998/data/pols-month.csv")%>%
                  janitor::clean_names()%>%
                  separate(mon,into = c("year", "month","day"), sep = "-")%>%
                  mutate(month = month.name[as.numeric(month)])%>%
                  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("prez"),
                               names_to = "president",
                               names_prefix = "prez_" )%>%
                  filter(value == 1)%>%
                  select(-day,-value)
 
snp_data  =   read_csv("~/Desktop/data science/p8105_hw2_al3998/data/snp.csv")%>%               
              janitor::clean_names()%>%
              separate(date,into = c("month", "day","year"), sep = "/")%>%
              arrange(year, month)%>%
              mutate(month = month.name[as.numeric(month)])%>%
              select(year,month,close,-day)

 
 unemployment_data = read_csv("~/Desktop/data science/p8105_hw2_al3998/data/unemployment.csv")%>%
                     pivot_longer(
                     cols=Jan:Dec,
                     names_to = "month")%>%
                     arrange(Year,month)%>%
                     mutate(month = match(month, month.abb))%>%
                     mutate(month = month.name[month])%>%
                     mutate(year = as.character(Year))
## merging data                    
pols_snp_data = left_join(pols_month_data, snp_data,by = c("year","month"))      
pols_snp_une_data = left_join(pols_snp_data, unemployment_data,by = c( "year","month"))
```

The first data frame “pols\_month\_data” is a data frame with 817 rows
and 9 columns, the range of the year in this adta set is from 1947 to
2015,and the name of key variables in this data set are year, month,
gov\_gop, sen\_gop, rep\_gop, gov\_dem, sen\_dem, rep\_dem, president

The second data frame “snp\_data” is a data frame with 787 rows and 3
columns, the range of the year in this adta set is from 1950 to 2015,and
the name of key variables in this data set are year, month, close

The third data frame “unemployment\_data” is a data frame with 816 rows
and 4 columns, the range of the year in this adta set is from 1948 to
2015,and the name of key variables in this data set are Year, month,
value, year

After merging the three data sets,the data sets called
“pols\_snp\_une\_data” include 817 rows and 12 columns.Some data in
this data set is missing because that the range of years are
different.

## Problem 3

## Load and tidy the data

``` r
popular_baby_data = read_csv("~/Desktop/data science/p8105_hw2_al3998/data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv")%>%
                    janitor::clean_names()%>%
                    mutate(ethnicity = recode(ethnicity,"ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER" = "ASIAN AND PACI","BLACK NON HISPANIC" = "BLACK NON HISP","WHITE NON HISPANIC" = "WHITE NON HISP"))%>%
                     mutate(childs_first_name = str_to_title(childs_first_name))%>%
                     distinct()
```

## Produce a table showing the rank in popularity of the name “Olivia”

``` r
    Olivia_data = popular_baby_data %>% 
    filter(gender == "FEMALE" & childs_first_name == "Olivia") %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = year_of_birth, values_from = rank,id_cols = ethnicity)
```

## Producing a table showing the most popular name among male children over time.

``` r
   male_data = filter(popular_baby_data,gender == "MALE")%>%
   group_by(childs_first_name)%>%
   summarise(count_sum = sum(count))%>%
   arrange(desc(count_sum))
   male_table = filter(popular_baby_data,gender == "MALE" & childs_first_name =="Ethan")%>%
   pivot_wider(names_from = year_of_birth, values_from = rank,id_cols = ethnicity)
```

## producing a scatter plot

``` r
  plot_data = filter(popular_baby_data,gender == "MALE",ethnicity == "WHITE NON HISP",year_of_birth == "2016")
  ggplot(plot_data,aes(x = rank,y = count))+geom_point()+xlab( "rank of the names")+ ylab( "number of children with a name")
```
